# Local Development

This project uses a Python virtual environment for local development to test the `ipbuilding` custom component.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.14 or higher installed (the project now uses Python 3.14).
-   The virtual environment is created in the `venv` directory.

## Setup

1.  **Run the setup script:**

    ```bash
    ./setup_local_ha.sh
    ```

    This creates (or recreates) the `venv` virtual environment, installs Home Assistant, and links the custom component.

2.  **Start Home Assistant:**

    ```bash
    ./venv/bin/hass -c config
    ```

    Or activate the venv first:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    hass -c config
    ```

3.  **Access Home Assistant:**

    Open your browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123)

    You will need to go through the initial Home Assistant onboarding process (create a user, etc.). This data is stored in the `config` directory and will persist between restarts.

4.  **Add the Integration:**

    - Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**.
    - Click **Add Integration**.
    - Search for **IPBuilding**.
    - Follow the configuration steps.

## Rebuilding

Since the component is symlinked, changes to the Python files should be picked up after restarting Home Assistant.

To restart, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the process, then run `./venv/bin/hass -c config` again.
