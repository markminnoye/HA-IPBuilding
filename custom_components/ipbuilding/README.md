# IPBuilding Custom Component

## Overview

This Home Assistant custom component provides integration with the IPBuilding system. It allows you to control dimmers, retrieve sensor data, and trigger custom actions via the IPBuilding REST API.

## Supported Platforms

The integration automatically discovers and creates entities for the following IPBuilding device types:

- **Lights**: Dimmers (Type 2) and Relays with Kind=1 (Type 1)
- **Switches**: Relays (Type 1) with Kind≠1 (outlets, locks, fans, valves, etc.)
- **Sensors**: 
  - Time sensors (Type 56)
  - Regime sensors (Type 200)
  - Power sensors (automatically created for devices with `Watt` attribute)
- **Buttons**: Button devices (Type 50)
- **Scenes**: Sphere (Type 100) and TempSphere (Type 101) devices

## Important API Endpoints

### Dimmer Control

- **Endpoint**: `GET http://192.168.0.185:30200/api/v1/action/action?id=571&actionType=DIM&value=10`
- **Description**: Sets the dimmer with ID `571` to a value of `10` (range depends on your device).

### Other Useful Endpoints

- **Send an Action**: https://www.postman.com/soft-techbv/ipbrestapi-s-public-workspace/request/6uctjo4/send-an-action
- **Client Command**: https://www.postman.com/soft-techbv/ipbrestapi-s-public-workspace/request/mgu7sxs/client-commando
- **Temperature Deviation**: https://www.postman.com/soft-techbv/ipbrestapi-s-public-workspace/request/51zmehz/temperature-deviation
- **Trigger Custom Item Action**: https://www.postman.com/soft-techbv/ipbrestapi-s-public-workspace/request/h59aed0/trigger-customitem-action
- **Get Version**: https://www.postman.com/soft-techbv/ipbrestapi-s-public-workspace/request/2ygfarm/get-version

## Usage in Home Assistant

The component exposes services that wrap these API calls. Refer to the component's `services.yaml` (if present) or the code in `api.py` for the exact service names and parameters.

### Entity Features

#### State Visibility
For a cleaner UI, certain entity types have their state display hidden by default:
- **Buttons**: All button entities have state display disabled (`entity_registry_visible_default = False`)
- **Power Sensors**: Energy/power sensors created from the `Watt` attribute also hide state display by default

These entities remain functional but don't clutter the dashboard with unnecessary state information.

#### Visible Property
The integration respects the `Visible` property from the IPBuilding API. Entities with `"Visible": false` will be marked as unavailable in Home Assistant.

#### Power Monitoring
The component automatically creates power sensor entities for any Relay or Dimmer device that has a `Watt` attribute. These sensors:
- Use the `sensor` device class for power measurement
- Report power in Watts (W)
- Can be used in Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard
- Are linked to the same device group as their parent entity

#### Device Grouping
All entities are automatically grouped by their IPBuilding `Group` property:
- Each entity is linked to a device based on `Group.ID` and `Group.Name`
- This allows you to organize entities by room/area in Home Assistant
- The device manufacturer is set to "IPBuilding"

#### Entity Attributes
All entities expose the following IPBuilding properties as attributes:
- `IpAddress`: IP address of the physical device
- `Port`: Port number
- `Protocol`: Communication protocol
- `ID`: IPBuilding device ID
- `Status`: Current device status
- `Output`: Output configuration
- `Kind`: Device kind/subtype (see Kinds table below)
